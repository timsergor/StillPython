#We have an array A of integers, and an array queries of queries.
#For the i-th query val = queries[i][0], index = queries[i][1], we add val to A[index].  Then, the answer to the i-th query is the sum of the even values of A.
#(Here, the given index = queries[i][1] is a 0-based index, and each query permanently modifies the array A.)
#Return the answer to all queries.  Your answer array should have answer[i] as the answer to the i-th query.
